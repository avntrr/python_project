# Building Supermarket Self-Service Application with Python.
### A. Background
Shopping at supermarkets often requires a lot of time and effort, especially when there are long queues at the cashier or when searching for desired items. Self-service applications in supermarkets have become an innovative solution to speed up the shopping process and reduce waiting time at the cashier. I build a simple self-service application using Python, one of the most popular and easy-to-learn programming languages.
### B. Requirements
#### Library
```pandas``` : to perform mathematical operations in applications such as adding item prices or applying discounts. <br>
```class Transactions``` : to manage data and functions related to shopping transactions, this class will have the following attributes and methods:
```python
Attributes:

items: a list that contains shopping items
transactions: a list that contains transaction data
conn: a connection object to access SQLite database
c: a cursor object to execute SQL commands on the database
```
